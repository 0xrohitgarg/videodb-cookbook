    "1. For our demonstration, we've selected a 9-minute clip from Youtube that may contain some alchohol visual scenes . You can view the clip here: [Stop Drinking Alcohol now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE9K5N18rf0)\n",
    "2. We've done some analysis on this video and identified specific times when inappropriate video content appears. This was achieved using AWS Rekognition API. If you're curious about the full process, including how to find visual inappropriate content in a video, check out our [blog](https://docs.videodb.io/ensure-a-safe-and-family-friendly-viewing-experience-with-videod-6) where we walk through the entire process.\n",
    "3. In this blog post, however, we're going to skip the details of video analysis and jump straight to the timestamps.\n",
    "4. We've analyzed the appearances of visually inappropriate content, and then relatively computed the section  of video which are safe.\n",
    "5. Next, we'll upload the video to VideoDb and use these timestamps to clip the video. It's as easy as querying a database, but for videos ‚ö°Ô∏è!"
